But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?  There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the north.  There is a knife and a red hot pepper on the floor.. INVENTORY: You are carrying nothing.",

You can make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?  There is an open patio door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You don't like doors?
